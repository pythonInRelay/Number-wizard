# Number-wizard

### This is the first project I made in C# and Unity, which took me about 15 minutes total.

#### Instructions:

Use the **UP** or **DOWN** keys to have the computer guess your number between 1 and 1000.

When the computer is correct, press **ENTER/RETURN** and you will be told how many guesses it took to find your number.
