This is the first project I made in C# and Unity

**Time taken to completion: 15-20 minutes**

#### Instructions:

1. Use the **UP** or **DOWN** keys to have the computer guess your number between 1 and 1000.
2. When the computer is correct, press **ENTER/RETURN** and you will be told how many guesses it took to find your number.
